		<h1 id="top">Panda Travel Agency's Vacation Destination at Alcatraz</h1>
		<p><i>Alcatraz is a deserted prison located 1.25 miles offshore from San 
		Francisco. The small island consists of facilities for lighthouses, a military 
		fortification, and a military prison.</i></p>
		<p>Theories about the haunting of Alcatraz were based mostly on death in the 
		prison. Eight people were murdered by inmates, five men committed suicide, and 
		fifteen died from natural illnesses.<p/>
		<p>In June 1962 Frank Lee Moris and 4 other inmates escaped from Alcatraz. They
		tried to swim across the bay to shore but were unsuccessful and were presumed 
		dead. It is said that their spirits haunt Alcatraz in an attempt to repay for 
		their misfortune.<p/>
